    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\n\nContext\nHere we consider methods of simulating cropping systems where two ecophysiologically distinct PFTs are present at the same time. These include woody buffers and orchards with ground cover. Here, ecophysiologically distinct means that the two PFTs have different growth forms (woody vs herbaceous) and/or phenology (perennial vs annual).\nWe do not consider mixtures of plant species that are similar enough to represent as a single PFT, including cover crop mixtures and agroforestry. We note that the approach described below could be applied to these practices, and this will be considered if the additional complexity can be justified by potential reduction in uncertainty.\nWe also do not consider practices in which different crops are planted in sequence. These include crop rotations, cover crops, and land use change. These scenarios can be represented as sequential model runs that change PFTs while maintaining a continuously evolving system state.\n\n\nAlgorithm\nThe general approach for combining multiple PFTs into an aggregate estimate of carbon pool size (and later, GHG fluxes) is to:\n\nRun SIPNET separately for each PFT.\nCombine the model outputs from the individual PFT.\n\nTechnical details of these steps are described in more detail below.\n\nInitial Conditions Generation (IC)\n\nRun once for each PFT at each site.\nMeteorology and soil initial conditions:\n\nUse the same meteorological driver data (ERA5 ensemble).\nUse the same soil texture and soil organic carbon.\n\nSettings File:\n\nFor each mixed site, create separate a separate configuration file for each PFT; append -PFT to the site ID.\n\nFor herbaceous crops:\n\nAnnual herbaceous: assume start with bare ground (zero biomass).\nPerennial herbaceous: start as bare ground run; consider methods for estimating initial biomass in later iterations.\n\nFor woody crops:\n\nGenerate initial conditions.\n\n\n\n\nModel Execution\n\nExecute PEcAn SIPNET model independently for each PFT and site combination.\n\nUse ensemble methods to propagate uncertainty and variance in model parameters, meteorological drivers and initial conditions.\n\nFollowing PEcAn convention, netCDFs will be in out/ENS-{ensemble_number}-{site_id}-{pft}.\n\n\n\nPost-processing Outputs\n\nCombine outputs: For each mixed site, combine model outputs using one of the approaches defined below.\nStandardize Results: Outputs are formatted into ensemble files (combined_ensemble_output.csv) for downstream analysis and visualization.\n\n\n\nDownscaling and Analysis\n\nDownscaling:\n\nApply machine learning models trained separately for each PFT to downscale outputs.\nCombine downscaled outputs using one of the methods described below.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nCalibrate using site level mixtures.\nValidate against downscaled outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMixture Methods\n\nTwo Cases for Mixed Cropping Systems: Discrete and Overlap\nIn a mixed cropping system, we define \\(f_{woody}\\) and \\(f_{annual}\\) as the percent contribution of a crop or plant functional type to ecosystem dynamics. This contribution is not “canopy cover” since that changes over time. Think of this as “percent of a monoculture”. This method will build on SIPNET’s single PFT design - the outputs from two separate single PFT runs simulate will be combined.\n\n\nTable 1: Methods for combining two plant functional types (PFTs) in mixed cropping systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample System\nScenario\nMethod\nEqn.\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Crops + Woody Hedgerow\nDiscrete\nWeighted Average\n1\n\n\nOrchard + Ground Cover\nOverlap\nIncremental\n2\n\n\n\n\nNotation\nWe define the following values:\n\n\\(X\\) is the carbon stock (AGB or SOC).\nFor a finite time interval \\(\\Delta t\\) starting at \\(t_0\\) (the start of the simulation) the change is \\(\\Delta X_{\\Delta t} = X(t_0 + \\Delta t) - X(t_0)\\).\n\\(f_{woody}\\) and \\(f_{annual}\\) are the fractional contributions of each PFT to ecosystem dynamics. In the case of the discrete method, these represent cover and sum to 1. In the overlap case, \\(f_{woody} = 1\\) and \\(f_{annual} < 1\\).\n\n\n\nScenario 1: Discrete (Weighted)\nFor the Discrete case, we use a Weighted Average approach (Equation 1).\nThe Discrete case refers to mixed systems where the two different crops do not overlap. This covers two key scenarios: 1) each PFT occupies a distinct zones such as an annual crop with woody hedgerows or 2) a mixture of annuals. In this annual mixture case, the approach assumes that the plants do not overlap - even though this is not the case, it is a reasonable simplification. In the discrete case, the field scale ecosystem dynamics are approximated by weighting SIPNET outputs by the fractional area of each crop type within a field: \\[\nX_{\\textrm{site}} = f_{\\textrm{woody}}\\cdot X_{\\textrm{woody}} + f_{\\textrm{annual}}\\cdot X_{\\textrm{annual}}\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\n\nScenario 2: Overlap\nFor the Overlap case, we use an Incremental approach (Equation 2).\nThis scenario applies when a ground cover is added to an existing orchard orchard. We set \\(f_\\textrm{woody} = 1\\), reflecting the assumption that the addition of ground cover does not reduce the contribution of the woody species to ecosystem dynamics. Lowering this fraction below 1 at the moment of planting would represent an unrealistic scenario in which adding ground cover also reduced standing orchard biomass and associated impact of the woody species on ecosystem function. When woody biomass removal occurs, it is represented as a distinct harvest event.\nThe contribution of the ground cover is added incrementally to the system. The parameter \\(f_\\text{annual}\\) represents the “ecosystem impact factor” - the fraction of a monoculture’s influence on ecosystem functioning that the ground cover contributes to this mixed system.\nThis factor is always less than 1 (\\(f_\\textrm{annual} < 1\\)), as it accounts for both the percent of area covered by the ground cover and the reduction in its ecosystem impact due to competition for light and other resources.\nThus, when ground cover is added, it is treated as an addition to the ecosystem, and the orchard (woody monoculture) is assumed to remain unchanged.\n\\[\nX_\\textrm{site} = X_\\textrm{woody} + f_\\textrm{annual}\\cdot\\Delta X_\\textrm{annual}\n\\tag{2}\\]"

    "text": "Other Approaches Considered\nWe evaluated several alternative approaches for representing mixed cropping systems:\n\nFractional coverage approach (mosaic / tiling) Each PFT is simulated separately and then combined by fractional area weighting (Li & Arora, 2011). This is the “Discrete” method described above (Equation 1).\nComposite PFT approach A new parameter set is defined to represent the mixture as a single “composite” PFT (e.g., DayCent: Parton et al., 1998).\n\nVegetation demography approach Individual or cohort based models explicitly represent competition for light and resources among PFTs, as well as disturbance and successional dynamics (Fisher et al., 2018).\n\nLimitations:\n\nComposite PFTs: By lumping mixture components into a single parameterization prevents explicit evaluation of the incremental contribution of individual PFTs - it would be harder to compare an orchard monoculture to an orchard+ground cover system. It can also bias estimates of pools and fluxes relative to the weighted mixture model (Li & Arora, 2011).\nFractional weighting: While more realistic, this approach requires careful treatment of long-lived pools (e.g., soil organic carbon, woody biomass). If the PFTs share a common soil, raw stocks cannot be summed without double-counting; instead, \\(\\Delta\\) stocks relative to a common baseline (or shared-pool formulations) should be aggregated - as is done in the “Overlap” method above (Equation 2).\nDemography models provide mechanistic representation of competition but impose higher computational costs and require additional data and parameterizations (Fisher et al., 2018; Fisher & Koven, 2020)."
