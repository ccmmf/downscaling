# Variable importance and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)

This page reports variable-importance and partial dependence plots for the Random Forest models used to downscale AGB and SOC.

In the first plot, x axis is the importance of each variable, measured as the increase in mean squared error (MSE) when that variable is permuted (i.e., its values are randomly shuffled).
Higher values indicate that the variable is more important for accurate predictions. 

The next two plots show the partial dependence of the response variable (AGB or SOC) on the top two most important predictors, holding all other predictors at their average values. (= marginal effect of each predictor on the response variable). Here, the y axis is normalized.

### AGB

Here we see that vapor pressure deficit (vapr) is the most important variable, the second most important variable is precipitation (precip). Temperature (temp) and solar radiation (srad) are also important.

PDPs show negative trend - increasing vapr leads to lower AGB. While  increasing precip leads to higher AGB up to a point, after which there is a decline before levelling off.

### SOC (TotSoilCarb)

Here we see that vapor pressure deficit is again the most important variable, followed by temperature. PDPs show negative trends - increasing vapr or temp leads to lower SOC.
