# Overview

This document presents the results of downscaling workflow: soil carbon stocks and aboveground biomass in California cropland fields, aggregated to the county level.

The Results section presents the county-level carbon stocks and densities for soil carbon and aboveground biomass. The Analysis section explores results from the downscaling and aggregation analysis steps.

For detailed information about methods and workflow, please see the Workflow Documentation in [`docs/workflow_documentation.md`](https://github.com/ccmmf/downscaling/blob/update_site_selection/docs/workflow_documentation.md).

# Results

## County-Level Carbon Stocks and Densities

The following maps illustrate the spatial variation and uncertainty (mean and standard deviation) of the predicted carbon pools at the county level.

### Table of Carbon Stocks and Density by County

The table below provides a searchable summary of the county-level carbon stocks and densities.

```{r}
source(here::here("000-config.R"))

# Load county summaries data
county_summaries <- readr::read_csv(file.path(model_outdir, "county_summaries.csv"),
  show_col_types = FALSE)
#colnames(county_summaries)
# Combine mean and SD into a single column for carbon density
county_summaries_table <- county_summaries |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    `Mean Total C (Tg/county)` = paste0(
       signif(mean_total_c_Tg, 2), 
       " (", signif(sd_total_c_Tg, 2), ")"
    ),
    `Mean C Density (Mg/ha)` = paste0(
       signif(mean_c_density_Mg_ha, 2), 
       " (", signif(sd_c_density_Mg_ha, 2), ")"
    )
     ) |> 
     dplyr::rename(
    `Carbon Pool` = model_output,
    `County` = county,
    `# Fields` = n
     ) |> 
     dplyr::select(`Carbon Pool`, `County`, `# Fields`, `Mean Total C (Tg/county)`, `Mean C Density (Mg/ha)`)

# Analysis

## Design Point Distribution

Design points are representative locations selected to capture the range of environmental conditions across California croplands from CADWR (2018).
These are the locations where SIPNET is run to produce outputs later used in downscaling to all ~600k crop fields.

We used clustering to select design points that represent the range of environmental conditions across California croplands. 
The following figures illustrate the distribution of these design points, which were clustered based on environmental covariates.

The environmental covariates used for clustering are:


| Variable | Description | Source | Units |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| temp | Mean annual temperature | ERA5 | °C |
| precip | Mean annual precipitation | ERA5 | mm/year |
| srad | Solar radiation | ERA5 | W/m² |
| vapr | Vapor pressure deficit | ERA5 | kPa |
| clay | Clay content | SoilGrids | % |
| ocd | Organic carbon density | SoilGrids | g/kg |
| twi | Topographic wetness index | SRTM-derived | - |


### Map of Selected Design Points

Here we check the geographic distribution of design points relative to the distribution of all croplands. 
Grey areas are the fields in the CADWR (2018) land use dataset. 
Boundaries are Climate Zones from CalAdapt (Lyons, 2025).

The design points should be well distributed across California croplands and Climate Zones.

### Relationships Among Environmental Covariates

This pairs plot shows the relationships between covariates used for clustering, with colors indicating cluster membership.

The clusters should show distinct groupings based on the environmental covariates.

![Clustered Pairs Plot](../figures/cluster_pairs.png)

### Environmental Characteristics of each Cluster

These plots present This the normalized mean values of environmental covariates for each cluster.

This summary highlights the characteristics of each cluster based on the environmental covariates used for clustering.

Here we expect to see clusters with distinct environmental signatures, reflecting the unique multivariate profiles of each cluster.

## Variable Importance and Partial Dependence

The following plots show the variable importance from the random forest models used for downscaling, along with partial dependence plots for the top two predictors.

Variable importance quantifies how useful each covariate is in predicting the carbon stock<!-- or ghg flux-->. Partial dependence plots show the marginal effect of individual predictors on model response after averaging over the other predictors.
