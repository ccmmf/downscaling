# Workflow Overview

The downscaling workflow predicts carbon pools (Soil Organic Carbon and Aboveground Biomass) for cropland fields in California and then aggregates these predictions to the county scale.

It uses an ensemble-based approach to uncertainty propagation and analysis, maintaining ensemble structure to propagate errors through the prediction and aggregation processes.

## Terminology

- **Design Points**: Fields chosen via stratified random sampling using k-means clustering on environmental data layers across California crop fields.
- **Crop Fields**: All croplands in the LandIQ dataset.
- **Anchor Sites:** Sites used as ground truth for calibration and validation, including UC research stations and Ameriflux sites.

## Workflow Steps

### Configuration

Workflow settings are configured in `000-config.R`, except that the CCMMF_DIR is set in `.Renviron`. 
<!-- TODO: check why CCMMF_DIR is handled separately; 
     I think there were two related motivations
        1. .Renviron vars can be overridden by `export CCMMF_DIR=...` 
        2. renv directories are set there, using the CCMMF_DIR variable. 
           but also not sure why those wouldn't be in there.
The configuration script reads the CCMMF directory from the environment variable `CCMMF_DIR` (set in .Renviron), and uses it to define paths for inputs and outputs.

#### Configuration setup


To set up this workflow to run on your system, follow the following steps.

**Clone Repository**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ccmmf/downscaling

- `.Renviron` 
  - `CCMMF_DIR` should point to the shared CCMMF directory. 
    This is the location where data, inputs, and outputs will be stored, 
    as well as the location of the `renv` cache and library
  - `RENV_PATHS_CACHE` and `RENV_PATHS_LIBRARY` store the `renv` cache and library in the CCMMF directory.
    These are in a subdirectory of the CCMMF directory in order to make them available across all users 
    (and because on some computers, they exceed allocated space in the home directory).
- `000-config.R`
  - set `pecan_outdir` based on the CCMMF_DIR.
  - confirm that relative paths (`data_raw`, `data`, `cache`) are correct.
- For testing, keep `PRODUCTION` set to `FALSE`. This is _much_ faster and 
  requires fewer computing resources because it subsets large datasets. 
  Once a test run is successful,
  set `PRODUCTION` to `TRUE` to run the full workflow.

**Others:**

_these shouldn't need to be changed unless you want to change the default behavior of the workflow_

- `.future.R` defines parallel processing when the future package is loaded. 
  - set to `available cores - 1` by default
- `renv.lock` is used for package management with `renv`. 
See [project renv setup docs](renv_setup.md) for instructions about using `renv` for these workflows. 
See [renv package documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for more details.

**UdUnits dependency**

If you get an error installing the units package, this - or something similar - may help. 
We are working on an alternative to renv that will bundle system dependencies and hopefully make this and related challenges unnecessary.
install units package

```r
install.packages(
  "units",
  configure.args = "--with-udunits2-lib=/share/pkg.8/udunits/2.2.28/install/lib --with-udunits2-include=/share/pkg.8/udunits/2.2.28/install/include"
)
```


### 1. Data Preparation

```sh
Rscript scripts/009_update_landiq.R
Rscript scripts/010_prepare_covariates.R
Rscript scripts/011_prepare_anchor_sites.R
```

These scripts prepare data for clustering and downscaling:

- Converts LandIQ-derived shapefiles to a geopackage with geospatial information and a CSV with other attributes
- Extracts environmental covariates (clay, organic carbon, topographic wetness, temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, vapor pressure)
- Groups fields into Cal-Adapt climate regions
- Assigns anchor sites to fields

**Inputs:**

- **LandIQ Crop Map**: `data_raw/i15_Crop_Mapping_2016_SHP/i15_Crop_Mapping_2016.shp`
- **Soilgrids**: `clay_0-5cm_mean.tif` and `ocd_0-5cm_mean.tif`
  Consider aggregating 0-5,5-15,15-30 into a single 0-30 cm layer 
- **TWI**: `TWI/TWI_resample.tiff`
- **ERA5 Met Data**: Files in `GridMET/` folder named `ERA5_met_<YYYY>.tiff`
- **Anchor Sites**: `data_raw/anchor_sites.csv`

**Outputs:** 

- `ca_fields.gpkg`: Spatial information from LandIQ
- `ca_field_attributes.csv`: Site attributes including crop type
- `site_covariates.csv`: Environmental covariates for each field
- `anchor_sites_ids.csv`: Anchor site information


**Environmental Covariates**

| Variable | Description | Source | Units |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| temp | Mean annual temperature | ERA5 | °C |
| precip | Mean annual precipitation | ERA5 | mm/year |
| srad | Solar radiation | ERA5 | W/m² |
| vapr | Vapor pressure deficit | ERA5 | kPa |
| clay | Clay content | SoilGrids | % |
| ocd | Organic carbon density | SoilGrids | g/kg |
| twi | Topographic wetness index | SRTM-derived | - |

### 2. Design Point Selection

```sh
Rscript scripts/020_cluster_and_select_design_points.R
Rscript scripts/021_clustering_diagnostics.R
```

Uses k-means clustering to select representative fields plus anchor sites:

- Subsample LandIQ fields and include anchor sites for clustering
- Select cluster number based on the Elbow Method
- Cluster fields using k-means based on environmental covariates
- Select design points from clusters for SIPNET simulation

**Inputs:**
- `data/site_covariates.csv`
- `data/anchor_sites_ids.csv`

**Output:** 
- `data/design_points.csv`

### 3. SIPNET Model Runs

A separate workflow prepares inputs and runs SIPNET simulations for the design points.

**Inputs:**
- `design_points.csv`
- Initial conditions (from modeling workflow)

**Outputs:**
- `out/ENS-<ensemble_number>-<site_id>/YYYY.nc`: NetCDF files containing SIPNET outputs, in PEcAn standard model output format. 
- `out/ENS-<ensemble_number>-<site_id>/YYYY.nc.var`: List of variables included in SIPNET output (see table below)

 **Available Variables**

Each output file named `YYYY.nc` has an associated file named `YYYY.nc.var`. 
This file contains a list of variables included in the output.
SIPNET outputs have been converted to PEcAn standard units and stored in PEcAn standard 
NetCDF files. 
PEcAn standard units are SI, following the Climate Forecasting standards: 

- Mass pools: kg / m2
  - TotSoilCarb: Total Soil Carbon
  - AbvGrndWood: Above ground woody biomass
- Mass fluxes: kg / m2 / s-1
  - GPP: Gross Primary Productivity
  - NPP: Net Primary Productivity
- Energy fluxes: W / m2
- Other: 
   - LAI: m2 / m2

Rscript scripts/041_downscale_analysis.R
```

Builds Random Forest models to predict carbon pools for all fields:

- Train models on SIPNET ensemble runs at design points
- Use environmental covariates to downscale predictions to all fields
- Aggregate to county-level estimates
- Output maps and statistics of carbon density and totals

**Inputs:**
- `out/ensemble_output.csv`: SIPNET outputs
- `data/site_covariates.csv`: Environmental covariates

- `out/county_summaries.csv`: County statistics

## Technical Reference

### Ensemble Structure

Each ensemble member represents a plausible realization given parameter and meteorological uncertainty. This ensemble structure is maintained throughout the workflow to properly propagate uncertainty. For example, downscaling is done for each ensemble member separately, and then the results are aggregated to county-level statistics.
